<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Paulo GutiÃ©rrez, and I'm a *Full Stack Web Developer* <br/>
and an *Industrial Designer*. Both of them have in common that<br/>
they're user centered, both need proyectual managment and there's<br/>
always room for improvement.

I love to create, because I like to always add a part of me to <br/>
everything I do, so that there's more value than expected. This is<br/>
why I'm more inclined to pursue a front end job, however, I know<br/>
well how to work in back end environments.

Currently I'm studying and practicing best code practices and new<br/>
cool effects to add to my pages.

<h2>My Goal is...</h2>

To achieve the perfect amalgam between creativity and usability<br/> 
including most of the WCAG directives without relenting the <br/>
team's work. In order to do so, I intend to grow more <br/>
knowledgeable about the tech I'm working with, project by project<br/>
while reaching out for tech books, videos, blogs, etc.

It's always a continuum and that motivates me to keep up!

<hr/>
<h2>What can I do?</h2>

Web applications using:

- Semantic Html, pure CSS, JavaScript.
- React + Redux.
- Node + Express.
- Sequelize + PostgreSQL.
- NextJs + Tailwind.
- TypeScript + redux/toolkit + SASS.
- And I'm open to learn more technologies.

In my journey I've encountered a lot of teachings that </br>
really stuck with me. So far I'm good at:
- Responsiveness.
- Micro-Interactions.
- Accessibility.
- Deployment.
- Testing.
- BEM and clean code practices.
