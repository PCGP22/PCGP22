<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Paulo GutiÃ©rrez, and I'm a *Full Stack Web Developer* <br/>
and an *Industrial Designer*. Both of them have in common that<br/>
they're user centered, both need proyectual management and there's<br/>
always room for improvement.

I love to create, because I like to always add a part of me to <br/>
everything I do, so that there's more value than expected. This is<br/>
why I'm more inclined to pursue a front end job, however, I know<br/>
well how to work in back end environments.

Currently I'm studying and practicing best code practices and new<br/>
cool effects to add to my pages.

<h2>My Goal is...</h2>

To always keep learning something.

My main drive is knowledge, because i strive to be more and more<br/>
resourceful with the pass of time and projects. However without a<br/>
defined path, there's always the risk to forget some techniques,<br/>
that's why I'm looking for my first job opportunity, to delimit my<br/>
tech array and get as proficient as possible with each one of them.

Right now I've been self studying using youtube and medium.

<hr/>
<h2>What can I do?</h2>

Web applications using:

- Semantic Html, pure CSS, JavaScript.
- React + Redux.
- Node + Express.
- Sequelize + PostgreSQL.
- NextJs + Tailwind.
- TypeScript + redux/toolkit + SASS.
- And I'm open to learn more technologies.

In my journey I've encountered a lot of teachings that </br>
really stuck with me. So far I'm good at:
- Responsiveness.
- Micro-Interactions.
- Accessibility.
- Deployment.
- Testing.
- BEM and clean code practices.
