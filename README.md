<h1>Hi there 👋</h1>

My name is Paulo Gutiérrez, and I'm a backend developer with skills in frontend <br/>
I'm a developer that's interested in really understanding why some things work <br/>
the way they do, so I can come up with better solutions to the problems that <br/>
I'm solving. <br/>

<br/>

My main goal is to become an efficient and effective programmer so I decided <br/>
to stick to one tech stack while being versatile for any other tool I could <br/> 
possibly need.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the tech stack I'm focusing in is composed by: <br/>

<ul>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>Node</li>
  <li>Express.js</li>
  <li>Typescript</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
</ol>

<h2>My main strengths:</h2>

<br/>
I have experience in automations, maintaining/refactoring legacy code, <br/>
implementing brand new solutions with tech stacks I didn't know at the <br/>
moment, and AI based solutions like audio and documents analyzing.

Now I've been studying design patterns, OOP, the internals of JS and <br/>
each tool mentioned on my main tech stack, as a way to increase the level<br/>
of problems I can tackle. 

<h3>Soft skills</h3>

I like to be as useful as I can by asking questions, being accountable and <br/> 
owning the code put under my care, helping out my coworkers whenever<br/>
possible, taking the initiative to fix some bugs and constantly looking for<br/>
ways to improve my current skillset. On the other hand, I'm lively, patient,<br/>
kind and understanding which helped me appease the clients upset whenever <br/>
they weren't satisfied with the product I was working into with my <br/>
coworkers.

<h2>Achievements</h2>

As someone as curious and knowledge seeking, I was able to become the <br/>
developer that could be trusted any new project, new as in something that <br/>
required a different stack, like react-native, puppeteer, selenium, python, <br/>
etc. This granted me the responsibility to fix the most important project <br/>
the company had at the time, one that opened the door to a closer relationship <br/>
with the client, boosting the company's revenue by almost 6 million MXN.

Also I was put in charge of optimizing queries, the most extreme case was <br/>
passing from a solid 2 minutes in querying a virtual table in postgresql <br/>
to 10 seconds tops.
