<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Paulo GutiÃ©rrez, and I'm a *Full Stack Web Developer* </br>
who also happens to be an *Industrial Designer*. The thing they </br>
have in common is that they can create both *attractive* and</br>
*functional* designs while focusing on user accessibility.

I'm really passionate about styling due to the design nature</br>
of my former career, but still proficient at back-end </br>
programming.

Currently I'm studying and practicing the MERN stack in order</br>
to open more job opportunities.

<h2>My Goal is...</h2>

To achieve the perfect amalgam between creativity and usability</br> 
including most of the WCAG directives without relenting the </br>
team's work. In order to do so, I intend to grow more </br>
knowledgeable about the tech I'm working with, project by project</br>
while reaching out for tech books, videos, blogs, etc.

It's always a continuum and that motivates me to keep up!

<h2>What can I do?</h2>

Web applications using:

- Semantic Html, pure CSS, JavaScript.
- React + Redux.
- Node + Express.
- Sequelize + Postgresql
- NextJs + Tailwind
- Mongodb + Mongoose
- And I'm open to learn more technologies.

In my journey I've encountered a lot of teachings that </br>
really stuck with me. So far I'm good at:
- Responsiveness.
- Micro-Interactions.
- Accessibility.
- Deployment.
- Testing.
- BEM and clean code practices.
